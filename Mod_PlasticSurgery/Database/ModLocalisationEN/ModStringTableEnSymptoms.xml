		<Text>A scar is a mark that is left on the skin after a wound or an injury to the surface of the skin has healed. The formation of scars or scar tissue is a normal part of the healing process, and occurs when the skin is cut due to injury or surgery. The growth of scar tissue is influenced by many factors, these include: The severity of the original injury. The size, depth and location of the wound on the body. Excess scar tissue, layers deep, can significantly reduce function and movement months after surgery. This can have negative effects and decrease patient satisfaction.</Text>

Any full-thickness injury to the cornea, sclera, or both is considered an open globe injury and is approached in the same manner in the acute setting. Globe rupture is an ophthalmologic emergency and prompt action is critical to maximizing functional outcome. Although the globe's position within the orbit protects it from injury in many situations, damage to the posterior segment of the eye is associated with a very high frequency of permanent visual loss.</Text>

		<Text>Conjunctival inclusion cysts occur when conjunctival epithelial cells are buried beneath the conjunctival surface during surgery. These cells can multiply over time to create a subconjunctival cyst days to years after the original surgery.

		<Text>Local anaesthetic toxicity generally occurs as a result of therapeutic error. Situations leading to toxicity include inadvertent venous or arterial injection as well as too high a dose of ingested or topically administered local anaesthetic-containing preparations. The CNS is more sensitive to the effects of local anesthetics than the cardiac system and will generally manifest signs/symptoms of toxicity first.</Text>

		<Text>When fat is removed from under the skin, some patients believe that their skin will shrink to fit their smoother, more toned body. However, this is not always the case, especially in the areas where the skin is significantly damaged. This is most common in the stomach and gluteal area, though it can occur all over the body. If skin has been stretched over fat deposits for a long period of time, it will may not tighten or shrink back when the fat deposits are no longer there. Any area that has stretch marks, for example, is unlikely to quickly tighten after liposuction. Excess and sagging skin is the most common cause for dimpling after liposuction.</Text>

		<Text>Blinking is a reflex, which means your body does it automatically. You can also make yourself blink when you want to. Excessive blinking is when you blink more than you want to. Excessive blinking is caused by over-stimulation of the blinking reflex. This is most commonly due to a foreign body in the eye. This can be as simple as an ingrown eyelash rubbing against the front of the eyeball. Thus anything which causes a corneal abrasion causes excessive blinking and watering in an attempt to wash out the foreign body. Excessive blinking may also be caused by allergic reactions causing watering, itching and roughening of the conjunctiva. There are other also many other disease states associated with excessive blinking. Treatment for excessive blinking depends on the underlying cause.</Text>

		<Text>Conjunctival scaring can be a persistent problem after surgery. Instead of returning to the typical translucent white appearance, the conjunctiva can remain chronically hyperemic and pink. Many conditions can cause the conjunctiva, the thin transparent membrane that covers the white of the eye and the underside of the eyelids, to become scarred. Scarring damages the conjunctiva and prevents it retaining the protective mucous layer, which helps tears adhere to the surface.</Text>
