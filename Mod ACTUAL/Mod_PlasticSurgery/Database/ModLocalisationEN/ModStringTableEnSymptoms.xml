		<Text>Postoperative neuropathic pain (PONP) can develop if nerves were damaged during a surgery. Damaged nerves cannot correctly transmit signals from various parts of the body to the brain. Instead, these signals become exaggerated, causing chronic pain that may persist for months or even years.</Text>

Post-treatment undesired results occur after a surgery or treatment has been completed and the result differs from what was expected.

		<Text>A scar is a mark that is left on the skin after a wound or an injury to the surface of the skin has healed. The formation of scars or scar tissue is a normal part of the healing process, and occurs when the skin is cut due to injury or surgery. The growth of scar tissue is influenced by many factors, these include: The severity of the original injury. The size, depth and location of the wound on the body. Excess scar tissue, layers deep, can significantly reduce function and movement months after surgery. This can have negative effects and decrease patient satisfaction.</Text>

		<Text>At face value, bacterial infection is a problem for any implantable medical device, including breast implants. Symptoms of an infection can include a high fever and breast pain, redness and/or swelling. If it appears that antibiotics alone won't clear the infection, then the surgeon may need to clean out the infected tissue and either replace or completely remove the implant.</Text>

		<Text>In relatively rare cases after implant reconstruction surgery, the surface of the implant or tissue expander comes through the skin and becomes exposed. This is called “extrusion". The patient may develop an infection if they have an extruded or exposed implant. If the breast implant has already extruded or is about to extrude, the plastic surgeon will have to remove it or replace it via corrective surgery.</Text>

		<Text>A nasal septum perforation is a medical condition in which the nasal septum, the bony/cartilaginous wall dividing the nasal cavities, develops a hole or fissure. Some perforations can cause bleeding, pain, and a whistling sound when inhaling. If dried blood or scabs build up, you could also have trouble breathing through your nose. Many perforations do not need to be closed but serious or complicated ones can lead to infections.</Text>

		<LocID>SYM_SLP_EYE_GLOBE_PERFORATION_DESC</LocID>                   
		<Text>Globe rupture occurs when the integrity of the outer membranes of the eye is disrupted by blunt or penetrating trauma. Any full-thickness injury to the cornea, sclera, or both is considered an open globe injury and is approached in the same manner in the acute setting. Globe rupture is an ophthalmologic emergency and prompt action is critical to maximizing functional outcome. Although the globe's position within the orbit protects it from injury in many situations, damage to the posterior segment of the eye is associated with a very high frequency of permanent visual loss.</Text>

		<Text>Unsatisfactory eye alignment after surgery is the most common complication when correcting Strabismus and other eye misalignment issues. Despite careful pre-operative measurements and utilization of common surgical dosage tables, a certain percentage of patients will be overcorrected or undercorrected after surgery requiring corrective surgical procedures to alleviate the issue.</Text>

		<LocID>SYM_SLP_EYE_CIC_DESC</LocID>                   
		<Text>Conjunctival inclusion cysts occur when conjunctival epithelial cells are buried beneath the conjunctival surface during surgery. These cells can multiply over time to create a subconjunctival cyst days to years after the original surgery. Conjunctival scaring is more common after a re-operation and also after a surgical resection, when advancement of the muscle belly may advance the thicker posterior Tenon’s capsule closer to the limbus where it is more visible.</Text>
