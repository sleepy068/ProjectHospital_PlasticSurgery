It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes flaccid paralysis. While useful for various Plastic Surgery procedures, Botulinum toxin is the most poisonous substance known. Intoxication can occur naturally as a result of either wound or intestinal infection or by ingesting preformed toxin in food. The estimated human lethal dose of type A toxin is 1.3–2.1 ng/kg intravenously or intramuscularly, 10–13 ng/kg when inhaled, or 1000 ng/kg when taken by mouth.  \n\nRequired room: Any office</Text>

Sclerotherapy irritates the vessel walls, making them stick together. This leads to fibrosis, or scarring, of the blood vessel. The unwanted veins injected with a sclerosing solution then dissolve over a period of weeks as the body naturally absorbs the treated vein. Sclerotherapy is a non-invasive procedure taking only about 10 minutes to perform. The downtime is minimal, in comparison to an invasive varicose vein surgery. \n\nRequired room: Any office</Text>

			<Text>Corticosteroids (also known as steroids) are medicines that can be used to treat inflammation. When corticosteroids are injected into or around a painful area (such as a joint or muscle) they can reduce the inflammation in that area, relieving pain, reducing tissue swelling, and improving function and mobility. A Doctor may inject a corticosteroid solution directly into a hypertrophic scar or keloid, which may help reduce its size. Steroids break the bonds between collagen fibers, which reduces the amount of scar tissue beneath the skin.  \n\nRequired room: Any office</Text>

			<Text>Cryosurgery is a type of surgery that involves the use of extreme cold to destroy abnormal tissues, such as tumors. The surgery most often involves the use of liquid nitrogen, although carbon dioxide and argon may also be used. Cryosurgery works by taking advantage of the destructive force of freezing temperatures on cells. When their temperature sinks beyond a certain level ice crystals begin forming inside the cells and, because of their lower density, eventually tear apart those cells. Further harm to malignant growth will result once the blood vessels supplying the affected tissue begin to freeze.  \n\nRequired room: Any office</Text>

In the skin hyaluronic acid attracts water, which allows the skin to become more hydrated. Injectable HA is used to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, facial folds, and to create structure, framework, and volume to the face and lips. The effects of injectable hyaluronic acid are seen immediately. \n\nRequired room: Any office</Text>
